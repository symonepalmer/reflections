Symone's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections (week 1)

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you report the bug?

It was helpful to get a feel for the layout of code, learning to adjust your eyes to focus on certain areas of a file to find what you're looking for. The diff function is definitely helpful to someone like me who might feel overwhelmed searching line by line for file differences.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can track your steps and better analyze your files and work history.

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You have better control over what changes you made, saving you time navigating to the correct change.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

My guess would be that programs like Google Docs don't keep track of "repositories"?

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log reports the commits, diff hilights the differences between two selected commits (placing the newest version first, the previous version last)

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control helps you feel more confident making significant changes because you know you have ready access to multiple checkpoints within your project.
